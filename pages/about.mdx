### What I'm all about

I've been passionate and committed developer for more than 4 years and have
been getting better at programming for most of the time. I may not know all
the principles and patterns but I usually know how to find the things I need.

### Coding History:

I started working as Freelance Desktop Application Developer using **C#** and developed some applications for small enterprises
using <a href="https://github.com/thielj/MetroFramework" target="_blank" aria-label="MetroFramework" rel="noopener noreferrer">MetroFrameworkUi</a>. These
applications features were to keep track of inventory, custormers and clients
information, generate invoices, bills and offer sales reports.

I also learned **PHP** whilst working as Desktop Developer.

### Then:

Later I got a job as a full-stack web Devloper. Where I got involved in main project. We spent two years developing a
highly complex **ERP system**.

I've also worked on several other projects and have been gaining experience with **Node.js** and **Express** while self-teaching.

### Now:

I am doing freelance work for international clients. I work mostly with Javascript ecosystem(**React**, **Node.js**).

I've also contributed a little bit in resolving issues of an open source software <a href="https://github.com/audreyt/ethercalc" target="_blank" aria-label="Ethercalc" rel="noopener noreferrer">EtherCalc</a>.

### Job:

If you want to hire me, I'm interested to work in companies that offer modern technologies such as **Node.js**, **Next.js**, **React.js**, etc. I am looking for a role that challenges me and where I can help designing solutions.
